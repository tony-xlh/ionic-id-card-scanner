# ionic-id-card-scanner

An Ionic demo to scan ID Card in Vue.

[Online demo](https://meek-capybara-b5f339.netlify.app/)

It can capture the photos of an ID card, extract the card owner's info by reading the MRZ with [Dynamsoft Label Recognizer](https://www.dynamsoft.com/label-recognition/overview/) and save the ID card in IndexedDB.

A license is needed to use Dynamsoft Label Recognizer. You can apply for one [here](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?product=dlr).
